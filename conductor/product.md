The project aims to provide a platform for users to test their own video game knowledge in a fun, interactive way. It strives to create an engaging experience where players can challenge themselves and the AI.

## Key Features
- **Expressive Mascot:** Quiz Bot, a mascot that reacts with various expressions (confident, nervous, victory, etc.) based on the progress of the game.
- **Multiple Game Modes:** Support for different gameplay styles, including the AI guessing the player's game and the player guessing a game chosen by the AI.
- **Engagement Mechanics:** Daily challenges and leaderboards to encourage consistent play and community competition.
- **Monetization:** Integrated ad banners and sidebars to support operational costs.

## AI Interaction Style
