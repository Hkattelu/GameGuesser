# Product Guidelines

## Voice and Tone
- **Sarcastic & Witty:** The game employs a personality-driven writing style. Use dry humor, playful roasts, and a bit of "attitude" to make Quiz Bot memorable and engaging.
- **Dynamic Persona:** Quiz Bot maintains a competitive and slightly arrogant "Final Boss" persona. He is encouraging (in his own way) when the player is winning, but becomes increasingly "salty," dismissive, or competitive when he is losing or being stumped.

## Visual Design Principles
- **Aesthetic Consistency:** Maintain the exact visual style currently implemented. New components must adhere to the existing retro, pixel-art, and arcade-inspired aesthetic without deviation.
- **Minimalist Layouts:** Prioritize layouts that focus entirely on the current question and the mascot. Avoid UI clutter to keep the player's attention on the core gameplay loop and the interaction with Quiz Bot.

## User Experience & Accessibility
- **Intuitive Interaction:** Ensure the "Yes/No" response loop remains the primary focus of the interface, keeping the experience accessible and fast-paced.
